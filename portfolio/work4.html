      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Create a poster for an upcoming or ongoing event of your choice. Use research to know what the event is about, when it is, and whether it’s free or not. These pieces of information must include in your design </p>

      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> For this project, I created an exhibition poster of Stanley Kubrick that is hosted in Denmark. Based on my research, this exhibition represents all of Stanley Kubrick’s work and processes throughout his career. Stanley Kubrick has a numerous amount of great films, so I wanted his excellence to show through my poster. Because It’s an exhibition poster, I wanted it to have a nice description about what the exhibition is about. For about ¼ of the poster, I dedicated it with information: What the exhibition called, what’s it about, the location, the dates, and the website for more information. For the actual photo and design, I created it with pure complexity. Kubrick’s films are known to be complex and filled with symbolisms. I created a design in Photoshop that represents that. I took a photo from Space Odyssey and filled its walls with his work. The different angles and shapes of the cutouts with the iconic scenes successfully deliver the complexity aspect of his films. The font choice I chose was Futura. I chose Futura because I wanted this poster to stand out and be bold. I wanted it to be STAN-LEY KUB-RICK (in all caps), to show his significance just from his name, rather than just Stanley Kubrick. The color choice from the background is black. I chose black because of the darkness in his movies and to balance and add contrast to the white background of the image.</p>
