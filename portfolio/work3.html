      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Create a poster of a well-known and significant artist. The artist must be already dead and the poster has to show why he/she was successful during their lifetime. It must present their life’s work throughout the whole poster.</p>


      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> For this project, I chose to create it all in Photoshop. This project was made best on Photoshop because I had to deal with a lot of editing of photos. Since all the movie photos are old and scratchy, I edited the sharpness and reduced the noise to give this poster more higher quality photos. The reason why I chose Alfred Hitchcock is because he is a significant and one of the most well known directors throughout history. He has revolutionized film industry by creating suspenseful films. For this project, my font choices reflect on his movie posters. I chose the font that closely resembles the original posters that was created to give it more of a visual effect. For the quote, I chose this particular Alfred
Hitchcock quote rather than another was because it’s a quote that sums up all his movies, which is full of suspense. The choice of adding the filmstrip is so that people, who don’t know who he is, can indicate that he is a director. The photos I chose are iconic scenes from his most famous movies such as Psycho, Rear Window, and Birds. The color choice I chose is a bright red to represent the blood in all his suspenseful films.
