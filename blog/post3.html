      <p>This article discusses about the importance of designing a website’s content first and then the homepage last. As an example, the article explains the core model process their team used to create the NCS’s website. NCS is a website that gives cancer,
        specifically lung cancer, more awareness. The core model lets the creator think in a different and specific way to help meet the goals of their website,“The core model ensures that we’re thinking about user needs all the way through the website
        design process, thinking holistically about goals instead of hierarchically”.(Aalen, 7). The core model is a strategy and idea tool that helps identify the most important aspects of a website and its content. There are many steps to the core model
        process.
      </p>

      <p>The first of the many steps, is to start at a different point. The designer first has to list down the business objectives and the user tasks. The business objectives indicate what the website should prioritized and their goals. The user tasks represents
        what people want to get down when they enter the website. In the article, there is a venn diagram of business goals and the user tasks. The content that can be categorized as both for business goals and user tasks, it will be considered the core
        pages of the website. These pages will be the highlight of the website and should be prioritized on. This is important because it will easier to know what to get done and it's a more organized way to create a website.
      </p>

      <p>After they have figured out what their main pages are, they conduct workshop. For this workshop, anyone can be on the team, meaning that they don’t necessarily have to be web designers. For the workshop, there
        is a handout that lists all the core page, the business goals, the user goals, the inward paths, core content, and the forward paths. Each one is essential to creating a successful page. For the workshop, the first thing that people need to fill
        out in the handout is what the core page is, which is form of cancer (i.e. lung cancer). After that is established, they need to list down the business goals and the user tasks for that. For business goals, they wrote down helping to increase
        knowledge about this cancer, and for user tasks they wrote the symptoms, how to prevent, etc.
      </p>

      <p>Next, they figure out the inward paths. The inward paths are basically tools that can help the users be lead to this page. For example, is someone google’s the world cancer symptoms, they will be able to see this page and look through it. The core
        content of the page will be what it is about. This is a way for the business goals and the user tasks to be able to interact and work together. The forward path is when they have successfully met the core content’s needs and the user would like
        to move on forward, a cancer helpline. With all this from the handout, it is best to think in a mobile device’s perspective. The mobile devices has a small screen and it can help prioritize the important contents.</p>

      <p>After all the core pages are done, that’s when they start making the homepage. It will be easier and simpler because they will know which content is the most important and which to put. Not only will it be more clear and organized, but it will help
        better the user experience when it comes to browsing a website. Because of this model, their website has gotten more views and better results each year. The deliverance of a website is important because it helps fill the needs of people.</p>

      <h3>My Overall Thoughts:</h3>
      <p>Throughout the whole article, I found this a truly informative and inspiring way to create a successful website. I mostly found every aspect of this article interesting because it was a step by step on how to think differently. I love ideas and
        strategies that can help make something more efficient and successful. This will definitely be a new tool for me when I start to make my own websites. As I was reading thing, and saw the handout, I honestly just wanted to print out a bunch those
        blank pages to help me navigate on creating each page. At first, I thought the handout was confusing, but as I got to learn how it works and what it is step-by-step, it was less scarier and a great way to organize the core pages of a website.
        For websites, I think that it’s important to focus on the content rather than how the homepage is. As I was reading, it reminded me of the fundamental way of writing code. When it comes to writing html, we are always taught to write outside in
        (so we don’t forget all the core tags), but in here, we have to think inside out (so we don’t forget about the core pages).
      </p>

      <p>As I was reading, it made me think of designer in a better way. I’ve always wanted to do web designing and UI/UX and I think that this article and what it teaches is a helpful tool on how to navigate the designers to create a design that will enhance
        the user experience. Before I had any knowledge of creating a website, I always thought about creating the home page first and creating links of what you need, but as I began to read this article, I realized that that way is not such a great idea,
        because it could leave a cluttered mess. In order to create a successful homepage, the designer needs to know what the main aspects and core pages first in order to know what to highlight.</p>
