      <h2 class="blogheaders"><strong>Follow Up Question:</strong> How Did People’s Mindset Change About the Internet Ever Since the Internet Became More Accessible?</h2>

      <time datetime="2018-04-04 20:00" class="poststime">April 4, 2018</time>

  <div class="posts">
      <p>The first article that I found was <em>“How the Internet is Altering Your Mind”</em>. In that article, it discusses about how the Internet has the power to physically rewire a person’s brain. In a study, they experimented on two groups by having
        to use the Internet for an hour a day. After six days and five hours on the Internet, the subjects of the experiment’s brain have already rewired. Throughout the article, it later discusses about Carr’s book and his argument. His argument is that
        the Internet has given our ability to learn a disadvantage, as it made our understanding <em>“shallow”</em>. He also has repeatedly seem a lack of human contact skills such as being about to have eye contact with others or the ability to notice
        verbal cues in conversations. He also argues that with the constant use of text messaging, it is hindering our creativity because we are not thinking by ourselves but with friends indicating that it is <em>“not an effective way to do things: we make more errors, and there’s a tendency to do things faster, but sloppier”</em>(Carr).</p>

      <p>The second article that I read was <em>“2010 : How is the Internet Changing the Way You Think?”</em>. From this article, the information that I got from it was that the Internet has increased our curiosity and imagination due to the Internet’s enormous
        capacity. It’s more of a counterargument for the first article as it discusses about the lack of creativity while this argues that it has expanded our creativities. The Internet has an abundance of information that any person can access with just
        a few keys away. Since the Internet has become more accessible, there has been a great amount of peer-to-peer sharing such as social media, making us more connected.</p>

      <p>In the third article, <em>“The Internet: Is it Changing the Way We Think?”</em> it discusses more about Carr’s argument and his headline “Is Google Making Us Stupid?”. Under the article, it has difference perspectives from people with different
        professions. Sarah Churchill, critic, argues that the Internet is a like free weights. As the brain is a muscle, the Internet continues to train the brain as it challenges the user. The only con is all the misinformation that is spread out in
        the Internet. She explains that <em>“we have free access to it, then the Internet can certainly be a force for education and wisdom, and not just for lies, damned lies, and false statistics”</em> (Churchill, critic). She later discusses how the
        Internet is just another medium with an archive. Naomi Alderman, novelist, argues that the internet is a strength and a weakness, depending on how you use it. She later expresses that it does change our brains and the way we think. For example,
        people would rather read a summary about a book rather than actually reading it. Ed Bullmore, psychiatrist, agrees that the Internet has made an impact on the way we use our things.</p>

      <p> In <em>“15 Big Ways The Internet Is Changing Our Brain”</em>, it lists down the pros and cons of how the Internet has changed the way we think. The ones that I found interesting were: Children are learning differently, we hardly ever give tasks
        our full attention, we don’t bother to remember, we’re getting better at finding information, IQ is increasing overtime, creative thinking may suffer, and we’re becoming physically addicted to technology. I found these specific ones differently
        because they are points that I never thought of in terms of Internet usage and access. A question that I began to think of was the education aspect of the Internet.</p>

      <h3>My Overall Thoughts</h3>

      <p> As I was researching, there were many arguments whether the increasing use of technology was either harmful or helpful to our brains. As I got deeper into the question, it became linked to human behaviors and how the brain reacts scientifically
        as we use the computer. I found this extremely interesting because I there was so many pros and cons on how the Internet affected our brain and personality. The Internet has created traits such as addiction. I think that the Internet has made
        us dumber and smarter at the same time. It has made us dumber because we begin to lack knowledge as we rely our knowledge on the Internet, but made us smarter because of all the wide range of information that it contains. Nicholas Carr argues
        that the increasing amount of Internet usage has made us lazy and lack creativity, while other writers argue against it. I think that the Internet has increased creativity because it is a way to look for inspiration. For example, as a designer,
        when I get uninspired, I look at images that will help spark my creativity and imagination. The questions that lead me during this research are more on the brain stimulation when people use the Internet. Another is the social aspect of the Internet,
        whether it is harmful or not and the results of human behavior in terms of social media. Even though social media helps us connect to many different people, has it actually made us anti-social? The Internet has made us smarter and gave us more
        knowledge about people and life, has it made society more depressed? Mental health and illness linked to social media?</p>
