				<h3 >Portfolio Design Process</h3>
				<time datetime="2018-05-22 20:00">Monday, May 22,2018</time>
					<div>
						<p>The first part of my design process for my portfolio page is research. I think that part is one of the most critical aspects of the process because I have to look at different types of portfolio pages and see which parts of their websites are successful and effective. During this research, I took the opportunity to analyze the fundamentals of creating a well-designed website that’s elegant and striking at the same time. After I did my research, I had to create a rough sketch of the layout of my portfolio and wireframes of my navigation. For the rough sketch, I didn’t really know the direction I was heading. I just put design patterns that many of the portfolio websites have such as a navigation tool horizontal at the top, the large header image, and the content follows below. For the navigation wireframe, I wanted to put important links. The main links I created was a home link, my work, an about me, my blog, portal page, and how to contact me. For the navigation, I’m contemplating whether to put a FAQ link or putting a FAQ link under my about me page if the viewer has any more questions.</p>

						<h3>The Importance of Designing for Mobile First</h3>
						<time datetime="2018-05-22 20:00">Thursday, May 10, 2018</time>
							<div>
								<p>The article, “The Importance of Designing for Mobile First”, discusses about how designing for a mobile device is a key to creating an efficient, successful, and functional website. It is a great strategy to design for mobile due to its smaller
					        screen. Since the designer has to work with a smaller screen, it will give the designer the ability to put the main and important parts of the website rather than a bunch of nonsense. With this technique of designing for mobile first, it helps
					        create a faster loading website in the desktop because of the adjustments. One key concept in the article is how browsing the internet and searching the web is increasing in mobile devices. It provides a line chart that analyzes the decline of
					        web browsing in the desktop and the increase of web browsing in the mobile device. With this piece of information, it indicates that designing for mobile is a key aspect to creating a successful website that can be easily reached through multiple
					        devices without a problem.</p>
